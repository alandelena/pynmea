PyNMEA
======

This is a small library to help parse NMEA data.

I've not got a device that supports all of the sentences, so please report any
inaccuracies that you may find so that the tests and test data can be updated.

Python versions
---------------

The library has been tested with both Python 2.7 and 3.4
