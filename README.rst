PyNMEA
======

This is a small library to help parse NMEA data.

I've not got a device that supports all of the sentences, so please report any
inaccuracies that you may find so that the tests and test data can be updated.

`pynmea2
<https://github.com/Knio/pynmea2>`_ is a library based on this code, but has far more activity, so please
check them out if you're building something that needs NMEA as it has more features and you're much
more likely to get issues seen to in a timely manner!

Python versions
---------------

The library has been tested with both Python 2.7 and 3.4
